plot

	$ plot [<xrange>] <function or 'datafile'> [title 'str'] [with
	<style>] [pointtype n] [linetype n]

	examples:

	$ plot [-pi:pi] sin(x)

replot
	
	usage is the same with plot. use this command to draw another plot
	on the same graph.

splot
	
	$ splot [<xrange>] [<yrange>] <function>

with
	
	$ plot <...> with <style>
	
	styles:

	line						# draw with line (default)
	points						# draw with points
	linespoints					# draw with lines and points
	boxes						# draw with boxes

	linetype n					# include the color and the shape
	pointtype n					# include the color and the shape
	linewidth n
	pointsize n

using
	
	$ plot 'datafile' using l:m:n	
								# use colomn l m n in datafile as x y z
set

	$ set <option>
	
	options:

	arrow from x1,y1 to x2,y2	# draw arraw on graph
	arrow ... nohead			# draw line
	border n					# border type
	grid						# show grid
	key							# show legend (which is default)
	key right bottom outside	# set the position of legend
	key x,y						# set the accurate position of legend
	key box						# set the style of legend
	label 'str' at x,y			# put text on x,y
	mxtics n					# set number of subtics
  *	output <filename>			# set target file
	origin x,y					# pos of left right corner. 0 < x,y < 1
  *	size square					# make unit for x = unit for y
	size x,y					# 0 < x,y < 1
	style function ...			# set style of function before using plot
	style data ...				# set style of data before using plot
	terminal <device>			# type of terminal
  *	title 'str'					# title of the graph
  *	xlabel 'str'				# label of x-axis
  *	xrange [lo:hi]				# range of x
  *	xtics x						# set the tics width on x-axis
	xtics nomirror				# ?
	x2tics						# set the upper x-axis
	xtics ('label1',value1,...)	# set the number on x-axis
	dgrid3d m,n					# grid number of 3d graph
	contour						# draw contour (deng3 gao1 xian4)
	cntrparam levels increnental -0.9 0.1 0.9
								# ??
	view m,n					# the point of observer when in 3d mode
	surface
	pm3d
	isosamples m,n

	examples:

	1. to draw on ps or eps file:

	$ set terminal post eps color solid enhanced
	$ set output 'graph.eps'
	$ plot ...

	post - postscript mode.
	color - needed or it will save as black and white
	solid - use solid lines for all plots
	enh - enable superscripts, subscripts, greek letters and so on

unset

	opposite to set.

multiplot

    set xrange [-pi:pi]
    # set the size and origin before going to multiplot mode
    # This sets up bounding boxes and may be required on some terminals
    set size 1,1
    set origin 0,0
 
    # Done interactively, this takes gnuplot into multiplot mode
    set multiplot
 
	# left top
    set size 0.5,0.5
    set origin 0,0.5
    plot sin(x)

	# left bottom
    set origin 0,0
    plot 1/sin(x)
 
	# right top
    set origin 0.5,0.5
    plot cos(x)
 
	# right bottom
    set origin 0.5,0  
    plot 1/cos(x) 

    # On some terminals, nothing gets plotted until this command is issue 
    unset multiplot  
    # remove all customization  
    reset
